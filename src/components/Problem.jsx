                    DOHS is a holistic and systems-based approach that recognizes the interconnection between the health of humans, animals,
                    plants, and the environment. This potent and intelligent mapping effectively informs and predicts future infectious
                    diseases, environmental dangers, and health hazards, positively influencing improvements in disease surveillance,
                    environmental protection, and food security.

                    Our innovative system harnesses the power of advanced data analytics and AI to predict and respond to these threats.
                    By fostering collaboration among various sectors, we aim to enhance disease surveillance, environmental protection, and
                    food security. The relationship between health, food production, and natural systems is integrated to transform the
                    interactions between humans, animals, plants, and the environment. This holistic integration promotes futuristic economic,
                    environmental, and social sustainability.

                    For most sub-Saharan countries, case management systems and incident reporting systems for animals, plants, and the
                    environment are either not operational or do not share real-time data to rouse technical attention on community health.
                    The gap in effective outreach response from intersectoral spillovers to and from other sectors must be integrated
                    intelligently and analytically into every OH surveillance system without waiting for rippling effects or receding to
                    prolonged human assessment. Consequently, DOH systems need to advance into defining systems of information exchanges
                    between the stakeholder agencies to promote interagency participation and close stakeholder inclusion gaps. Even more,
                    to be able to assess country-level preparedness for localized and innovative adoption of OH systems.
